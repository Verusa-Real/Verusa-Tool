### Profits

We as the Verusa team do NOT profit at all. This is only for educational purposes as it is just a fun project meant to teach coding for no paid price and no annoying ads!

### History

We created the tool at the end of 2024, the alpha version was born. We had a relatively small community surrounding the Verusa Tool with a decent Discord server with minimum functions only providing for basic needs. As discord updated, and our software got outdated, we decided to fight back and created the new beta version finishing it at the beginning of 2025. We changed the whole UI, New Website, New Github, we completly started from new beginnings as a inside joke Challenge to regain traction without any paid ads.
